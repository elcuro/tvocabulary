Croogo TVocabulary  plugin
------------------------------
Show Croogo vocabularies as threaded parent child tree navigation


How to install
------------------------------
- Log in to admin panel
- Go to Extensions > Plugins page
- Upload the zip file (available here)
- Click on tick/cross icon of 'TVocabulary' for activating or deactivating the plugin

IMPORTANT: Because now it is not possible to load tvocabulary element via core croogo
Layout helper without changing core files (or I don't know how), you must manually copy
tvocabulary element from plugin dir /view/elements/tvocabulary.ctp to your theme elements dir.
If you are using default croogo theme, copy it to /app/views/elements


Settings
------------------------------
Same setting syntax and options as in core croogo vocabularies,
Extra attributes:
"showNodes" (true) - disable showing nodes for term
"nodeController" (node) - controller for term nodes
"nodeAction" (view) - action for term nodes
"nodePlugin" (false) - plugin for term nodes
"nodeTagAttributes" (array) - attributes for <li> element


How to use
------------------------------
- create vocabulary in admin: Content/Taxonomy/Add new
- add some terms with parent child structure
- create block: Blocks/New block
- to body area type something like this:
[vocabulary:your_vocabulary_alias element="tvocabulary"]

Showing child nodes for term is default enabled, you can disable
it by setting showNodes attribute to false
e.g.: [vocabulary:your_vocabulary_alias element="tvocabulary" showNodes="false"]

This plugin is so fresh, so there can be some bugs. Report it to me
